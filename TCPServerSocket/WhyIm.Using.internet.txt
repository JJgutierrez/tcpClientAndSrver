Mostly of my research is sockets and tcp
and How to handle data
many examples online are really bad.
I spended a least 4 hours watching videos online courses
and Udemy courses that help a little.
right now I'm looking a way to direct communication between client to client.

I really enjoy this project
mostly because give me the change too better understand 
code organization and better understanding how data is been transfer.
